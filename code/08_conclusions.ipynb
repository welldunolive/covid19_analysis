    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "Is it possible to predict COVID-19 severity using demographic data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies have indicated that COVID-19 affects parts of the population more severely, such as older individuals and males <sup>[1,2]</sup>. At the same time, the World Health Organization has stated that lockdowns and other restrictive measures meant to stop the spread of the virus \"can have a profound negative impact on individuals, communities, and societies by bringing social and economic life to a near stop.\" <sup>[3]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Though COVID-19 research is ongoing, an analysis of COVID mortality and/or case rates in combination with demographic data might provide insights into communities more or less at risk.  These insights might enable more targeted measures commensurate with a specific community's risk, thus improving the welfare of all involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis examines county-level COVID-19 testing, case, and death data alongside county-level demographic data for five US states. Demographic data such as age, gender, race, and income per capita is collected using the U.S. Census Bureau's API. COVID-19 and other health data is gathered from the CDC and state-specific health departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is cleaned, pre-processed, and normalized for population. Features for modeling are evaluated and selected. Regression models are built to predict cases/100 people. Classification models are built to predict a class of COVID severity based on cases/100 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is modeled across five states and for each state individually. Conclusions are drawn. Possible next steps for further modeling are discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Models Summary\n",

    "- [Modeling all five States](../code/06_modeling_five_states.ipynb)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We weren't able to achieve high accuracy when we used all five states data for modeling, however, the models performed significantly better in some cases when we used state-level data for our of our models.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*See the [table](#Table-comparing-all-models) below comparing all models.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This variation in models' predictive accuracy between all five states and state level data can be explained by data variation from one state to another, which eventually led to disparities between state-level models in terms of predictive features importance. For instance, population density and income per capita were the two most important features in our model using data from all five states, but other features like race percentage, age groups percentage, and having health insurance were more important in models using state-level data."

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demographic data can explain some of the variability in when predicting COVID severity in different US counties.\n",
    "- Population density and income per capita were the two strongest predictive features we using data from all five states.\n",

    "# Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "This work could be improved in the future through the following: \n",
    "- Gathering more data for both these state and others.\n",
    "- Updating the interactive app to include new data and states.\n",
